Dashboard and Metrics Implementation Plan
Here's a comprehensive plan for implementing the home page dashboard with profit metrics, sales information, and payment type analysis:
Database Structure
First, you'll need these core tables in Supabase:
transactions - Stores sale transactions with:
Transaction details (id, date_time, subtotal, tax, discount, total)
Relations (customer_id, employee_id, branch_id)
Payment information (payment_method, status)
transaction_items - Individual items in each transaction:
Links (transaction_id, item_id)
Pricing (unit_price at time of sale, cost_price at time of sale)
Quantities and totals
Refund tracking
Additional support tables that link to your existing tables:
items (existing)
branch_inventory (existing/planned)
customers (existing)
employees
Key Metrics Calculations
Sales Metrics
Total Sales: Sum of transaction totals in a given period
Average Transaction Value: Total sales divided by transaction count
Top Selling Products: Group by items, sum quantities, sort by volume
Sales by Category: Group by category, sum sales amounts
Profit Metrics
Gross Profit: For each transaction item, calculate (sale_price - cost_price) Ã— quantity
Profit Margin: Gross profit divided by total sales, expressed as percentage
Profit by Category/Product: Group profit calculations by category or product
Payment Type Analytics
Payment Method Breakdown: Group by payment_method, count transactions and sum amounts
Average Sale by Payment Method: Total for each method divided by transaction count
Payment Method Trends: Group by time period and payment method
Operations & Customer Metrics
Sales by Time: Group transactions by hour of day
Employee Performance: Sales volume and averages per employee
Customer Analytics: New vs returning, average spend, visit frequency
Frontend Implementation
Create a custom hook useDashboardData:
Fetches all metrics in a single consolidated hook
Handles filtering by date range and branch
Supports real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
Provides loading states and data refresh functions
Dashboard UI Components:
Main dashboard with metric summary cards
Sales trend charts and payment method pie charts
Top products and category tables
Tabbed interface for detailed drill-downs
Filtering by date range and branch
Detailed Reports Pages:
Sales detail pages with time breakdowns
Product performance analysis
Customer insights page
Payment method analysis
Performance Considerations
Database Optimization:
Create stored procedures for common metric calculations
Add appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns
Use materialized views for complex aggregations
Real-time Updates:
Subscribe to transaction table changes for live dashboard updates
Only update affected metrics when new data comes in
Implement full refresh on a periodic schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes)
Caching Strategy:
Cache dashboard data client-side
Use time-based invalidation (e.g., refresh every minute)
Separate frequently changing metrics (today's sales) from historical data
