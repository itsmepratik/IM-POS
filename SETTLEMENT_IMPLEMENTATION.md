# Settlement Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive settlement functionality implemented for handling `ON_HOLD` and `CREDIT` transactions in the POS system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. API Endpoint (`/api/settle-transaction`)

**POST endpoint** for processing settlements:

- Validates transaction eligibility (only ON_HOLD and CREDIT types)
- Prevents duplicate settlements
- Creates new transaction records with types:
  - `ON_HOLD_PAID` for settled on-hold transactions
  - `CREDIT_PAID` for settled credit transactions
- Maintains audit trail by linking to original transaction via `original_reference_number`
- Verifies cashier credentials before processing

**GET endpoint** for checking settlement eligibility:

- Checks if a transaction can be settled
- Returns settlement status and details

### 2. Database Schema Updates

Applied migration: `add_settlement_transaction_types`

Changes:

- Added support for `ON_HOLD_PAID` and `CREDIT_PAID` transaction types
- Created indexes on `type` and `original_reference_number` columns for performance
- Added constraint ensuring settlement transactions have `original_reference_number`
- Added helpful comments documenting the settlement workflow

### 3. POS Page Settlement Modal

Enhanced the settlement modal workflow:

- **Step 1**: Enter transaction reference number
- **Step 2**: Verify cashier ID
- **Step 3**: Confirm and process settlement

Features:

- Real-time validation of reference numbers
- Cashier authentication via staff ID
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Success/error toast notifications
- Automatic modal reset on completion

### 4. Transaction Display Updates

Updated the transactions page to display settled transactions:

**Visual Indicators**:

- Settled transactions (`ON_HOLD_PAID`, `CREDIT_PAID`) display in **green** color
- Same green styling as regular sales for consistency
- Clear labels: "On-Hold Paid" and "Credit Paid"

**Additional Information**:

- Notes field shows original reference number
- Format: `Settled from: [ORIGINAL_REFERENCE]`
- Maintains complete audit trail

## Transaction Flow

### Settling an ON_HOLD Transaction

1. Customer returns to complete payment
2. Staff opens Disputes → Settlement
3. Enter original transaction reference number
4. Enter cashier ID for authentication
5. Confirm settlement details
6. System creates `ON_HOLD_PAID` transaction
7. New transaction appears in green on transactions page

### Settling a CREDIT Transaction

Same flow as ON_HOLD, but creates `CREDIT_PAID` transaction type.

## API Usage

### Settle a Transaction

```typescript
POST /api/settle-transaction
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "referenceNumber": "SALE-1234567890",
  "cashierId": "0001",
  "paymentMethod": "CASH" // optional, defaults to CASH
}
```

**Success Response (201)**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "settlementTransaction": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "referenceNumber": "ON_HOLD_PAID-1234567890",
      "type": "ON_HOLD_PAID",
      "totalAmount": "25.500",
      "paymentMethod": "CASH",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "originalTransaction": {
      "referenceNumber": "SALE-1234567890",
      "type": "ON_HOLD",
      "totalAmount": "25.500"
    },
    "cashier": {
      "id": "0001",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  },
  "message": "On-hold transaction successfully settled"
}
```

**Error Responses**:

- `400`: Invalid request data or transaction type not eligible
- `404`: Transaction not found
- `409`: Transaction already settled
- `500`: Internal server error

### Check Settlement Eligibility

```typescript
GET /api/settle-transaction?reference=SALE-1234567890
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "transaction": {
      "referenceNumber": "SALE-1234567890",
      "type": "ON_HOLD",
      "totalAmount": "25.500",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-28T09:00:00Z"
    },
    "isEligible": true,
    "isSettled": false,
    "settlement": null
  }
}
```

## Validation & Error Handling

### Pre-Settlement Checks

1. **Transaction Existence**: Verifies reference number exists
2. **Transaction Type**: Only ON_HOLD and CREDIT can be settled
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if already settled
4. **Cashier Validation**: Verifies cashier exists and is active

### Error Handling

- Network errors display user-friendly messages
- Failed settlements preserve modal state for retry
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if API unavailable

## Database Constraints

```sql
-- Ensures settlement transactions have original reference
ALTER TABLE transactions
  ADD CONSTRAINT chk_settlement_has_original_ref
  CHECK (
    (type IN ('ON_HOLD_PAID', 'CREDIT_PAID') AND original_reference_number IS NOT NULL)
    OR
    (type NOT IN ('ON_HOLD_PAID', 'CREDIT_PAID'))
  );
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create Test Transaction**:

   - Create an ON_HOLD or CREDIT transaction in POS
   - Note the reference number

2. **Test Settlement Flow**:

   - Navigate to POS → Disputes → Settlement
   - Enter the reference number
   - Enter a valid cashier ID
   - Confirm settlement

3. **Verify Results**:

   - Check transactions page for new green entry
   - Verify "Settled from" note shows original reference
   - Try settling same transaction again (should fail)

4. **Test Error Cases**:
   - Invalid reference number
   - Invalid cashier ID
   - Non-eligible transaction type (regular SALE)

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
bun run test:settlement
```

The test script validates:

- Transaction creation
- Settlement eligibility checks
- Successful settlements
- Database verification
- Duplicate prevention
- Error handling

## Files Modified

### New Files

- `app/api/settle-transaction/route.ts` - Settlement API endpoint
- `scripts/test-settlement.ts` - Automated test suite
- `SETTLEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files

- `app/pos/page.tsx` - Settlement modal logic
- `app/transactions/page.tsx` - Display logic for settled transactions
- `lib/hooks/data/useTransactionsAPI.ts` - Added car_plate_number field

### Database Migrations

- `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_settlement_transaction_types.sql`

## Security Considerations

1. **Cashier Authentication**: Requires valid staff ID
2. **Transaction Validation**: Server-side checks prevent invalid operations
3. **Audit Trail**: All settlements linked to original transactions
4. **Idempotency**: Duplicate settlements prevented at database level
5. **RLS Policies**: Leverage existing Supabase RLS (if enabled)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**:

   - Index on `type` column for faster filtering
   - Index on `original_reference_number` for settlement lookups

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Single query to check settlement eligibility
   - Efficient joins for customer and cashier data

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] Receipt generation for settled transactions
- [ ] Bulk settlement processing
- [ ] Settlement reports and analytics
- [ ] Email notifications for settled transactions
- [ ] Partial settlements for split payments
- [ ] Settlement reversal capability (with admin approval)

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify database constraints are applied
3. Ensure staff IDs are active in the system
4. Check network connectivity for API calls
