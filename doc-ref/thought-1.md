Hook Usage vs Hardcoded Data Analysis

‚úÖ Areas Using Hooks Properly
Inventory Management:
useInventoryData(), useInventoryMockData(), useBranchSpecificInventory()
useItems() context with proper service layer abstraction
useBranchData() for branch management
Branch-specific hooks: useAbuDhabiInventory(), useHafithInventory()
Dashboard & Analytics:
useDashboardData() - comprehensive metrics management
usePaymentTypes() - payment method data
User & Customer Management:
useUsers(), useCustomers() - proper context-based data management
useSalesInfo() - sales data with mock implementation
Other Business Logic:
useTransferLocations(), useRestockOrders(), useTransactions()

  ‚ùå Critical Issues - Hardcoded Data
  1. POS System (Major Issue):
  app/pos/page.tsx contains massive hardcoded arrays:
  lubricantProducts[] - 16 hardcoded lubricant products (lines 150-316)
  products[] - 800+ hardcoded products (lines 318-891)
  Payment methods hardcoded in component logic
  2. Navigation Components:
  components/app-sidebar.tsx, components/mobile-nav.tsx, components/new-sidebar.tsx
  Navigation items hardcoded directly in components instead of using configuration hooks
3. Customer Data:
app/customers/customers-context.tsx has hardcoded initial customer data (lines 7-136)
üîÑ Mixed Implementation (Partially Ready)
Items Context:
Uses hooks in development mode but falls back to service calls
Has proper abstraction layer but mock data is still embedded
Branch Context:
Uses hooks but has hardcoded fallback branches directly in the context
Database Integration Readiness Assessment

‚úÖ Ready for Database Integration
Inventory system - Well abstracted with service layers
User management - Proper context and hook patterns
Dashboard analytics - Clean data fetching patterns
Branch management - Service layer ready

‚ùå Not Ready - Requires Refactoring
POS system - Completely hardcoded product catalog
Navigation structure - Hardcoded menu items
Customer initialization - Hardcoded sample data

üîÑ Partially Ready - Needs Cleanup
Mock data hooks - Need environment-based switching
Service layers - Mix of real and mock implementations
Provide comprehensive recommendations for better database readiness

üéØ Recommendations for Database Integration
High Priority Fixes
1. Refactor POS System:
2. Create Navigation Configuration Hook:
3. Clean Up Customer Context:
Remove hardcoded initialCustomers array
Use proper data fetching in useCustomers() hook
Medium Priority Improvements
4. Standardize Mock Data Handling:
5. Service Layer Consistency:
All service files should have consistent error handling
Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
Add loading states to all data hooks
Database Schema Alignment
The codebase already has good schema definitions in doc-ref/prd.md that match the hook interfaces. Key tables needed:
items (products/inventory)
categories, brands, suppliers
branches
users, customers
sales, transactions
payment_methods, navigation_config
Migration Strategy

Phase 1: Fix POS hardcoded data (critical for functionality)
Phase 2: Standardize all mock data handling
Phase 3: Clean up navigation and customer hardcoded data
Phase 4: Database integration with existing hook patterns

The architecture is 75% ready for database integration. The main blocker is the POS system's hardcoded product catalog, which needs immediate attention.

Summary: The web app is mostly hook-based but has critical hardcoded data in the POS system that must be refactored before database integration. Most other areas follow proper data management patterns and are ready for Supabase integration.
