## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

Below, each functional requirement is listed with its associated automated test cases and outcomes.

### Requirement R-01 – User Authentication
The system SHALL allow authorised users to log in with valid credentials and prevent access with invalid credentials.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC001 | Successful login with valid credentials | ✅ Passed | Login flow operates correctly; valid user is redirected to dashboard. |
| TC002 | Login failure with invalid credentials | ✅ Passed | Incorrect credentials are rejected and an appropriate error message is shown. |

---

### Requirement R-02 – Product Selection & Cart Operations (POS)
The system SHALL enable users to browse products by category/brand and add them to the POS cart.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC003 | Add automotive products to POS cart | ❌ Failed | Catalogue did **not** display oil products; inventory data failed to refresh, blocking item selection. Root-cause likely missing seed data or incorrect filter conditions on category **"Oil"**. |

---

### Requirement R-03 – Discount Application
The system SHALL support applying line-item and cart-level discounts during a sale.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC004 | Apply discounts during sales | ❌ Failed | Product list for **Additives & Fluids** category returned empty (404 placeholder images). Discount workflow could not be exercised. Indicates product-fetch API or image/assets path issues. |

---

### Requirement R-04 – Checkout & Payment Processing
The system SHALL allow checkout using multiple payment methods and generate receipts.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC005 | Complete sale with multiple payment methods | ❌ Failed | No products displayed across categories → cart remains empty → checkout blocked. Same underlying catalogue/data-loading fault as R-02.

---

### Requirement R-05 – Inventory Synchronisation
The system SHALL automatically decrement inventory quantities immediately after a sale, including partial volume handling for oil products.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC006 | Inventory auto-update after sale with partial oil volume handling | ❌ Failed | Session unexpectedly logged out mid-flow; sale confirmation not reached. Also encountered repeated 404 image errors and missing ARIA description in dialogs, suggesting runtime errors affecting session state. |

---

### Requirement R-06 – Refund Processing
The system SHALL process refunds and restore inventory counts accordingly.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC007 | Process refund and update inventory | ❌ Failed | **Continue to Confirm** button unresponsive; Dialog accessibility warnings observed. Likely dead handler or disabled state logic regression. |

---

### Requirement R-07 – Inventory Management (CRUD & Batch Tracking)
The system SHALL allow managers to add, edit and batch-track inventory items including cost, quantity and expiration.

| Test ID | Test Name | Status | Findings |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| TC008 | Add, edit, and batch track inventory items | ❌ Failed (Incomplete) | Form opens and basic fields save, but batch details not persisted/verified yet. Multiple 404 placeholder images indicate missing asset paths; ARIA warnings on Dialogs. |

---

## 3️⃣ Overall Quality Assessment

* **Total Tests:** 8  
* **Passed:** 2  
* **Failed / Incomplete:** 6  

Current build does **NOT** meet critical functional requirements for POS catalogue, discount flow, checkout, inventory updates and refund processing. Immediate remediation required.

## 4️⃣ Root-Cause Highlights & Suggested Fixes

1. **Catalogue / Product Fetch Failure**  
   • 404 errors for `/placeholders/*.jpg` and missing product lists across categories suggest incorrect asset paths or missing seed data in Supabase storage/database.  
   • Verify Supabase tables `products`, `categories`, `brands`; ensure Next.js data-fetch hooks correctly query and transform results.  
   • Add graceful fallback when image not found; do not block product rendering.

2. **Dialog Accessibility Warnings & Frozen Buttons**  
   • Repeated `Missing Description or aria-describedby` warnings from Radix UI Dialog indicate components instantiated without required props, possibly preventing focus-trap → freeze.  
   • Audit all `<DialogContent>` usages; supply `aria-describedby` or disable `forceMount`. Ensure confirm buttons are enabled only when form state valid, not prematurely disabled.

3. **Session Reset during Long Flows**  
   • Unexpected logout hints at Supabase auth token expiry or overwritten `localStorage` state.  
   • Confirm `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` listeners and refresh token strategy.

4. **Performance & Main-Thread Blocking**  
   • Many 404 and warning logs may spam console and degrade performance.  
   • Memoise expensive calculations (e.g., `calculateAverageCost`) and debounced list refresh.

---

## 5️⃣ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Hot-fix product catalogue** so that items render even when image missing; verify DB seed.  
2. **Resolve Dialog accessibility props** and test all confirmation flows (discount, checkout, refund).  
3. **Review Supabase auth persistence** to stop session drops.  
4. **Re-run automated test suite** after fixes; target 100 % pass rate.  
5. **Add E2E test coverage** for modal open/close performance and ARIA compliance.
